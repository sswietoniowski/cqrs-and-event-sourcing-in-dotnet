# CQRS and Event Sourcing in .NET
This repository contains the start code and solutions for the <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/cqrs-and-event-sourcing-in-net/0636920080710/0636920080709/" target="_blank">CQRS and Event Sourcing in .NET</a> training course. It includes the code needed to follow along in the course.   

The start code for the class is found in the <a href="https://github.com/tndataab/cqrs-and-event-sourcing-in-dotnet/tree/main/source/CQRS%20-%20Start%20project" target="_blank">/source/CQRS - Start project</a> folder.

Feel free to submit an issue or <a href="https://tn-data.se/contact/" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you have suggestions to improve the code or training class.

The code in the class is influenced by the code and tutorial found at <a href="https://cqrs.nu" target="_blank">https://cqrs.nu</a>, a site I co-authored with my excellent colleagues.

## Usefull resources

Some examples:

- [Marten](https://martendb.io/) - .NET Transactional Document DB and Event Store on PostgreSQL,
- [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/eventstoredb) - EventStoreDB is an industrial-strength Event Sourcing database that stores your critical data in streams of immutable events,

These resources are about event storming (not event sourcing as such :-)), I've added them here for my own use ;-):
